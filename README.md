# Inspiration
In the modern era there are a plethora of online resources and programs created to help students study, however, studying efficiently is still a struggle every student faces partially due to the fact that every resource covers a topic rather than being tailor made for what the student needs to know for their exams. Given how personal and widespread this struggle is we sought to create a webapp that would take an input of text the student is being tested on and produce an output of questions and answers based on the input, thereby removing any irrelevant information commonly found on other sources. We hope that by creating StudyBuddy we will give struggling students another avenue to tackle their studies efficiently. 

# The Problem
Many students do not know a successful and efficient way to study; Study Buddy is designed to effortlessly create study questions that will allow students to be successful in all of their assessments.

# What does it do?
StudyBuddy takes a wall of text inputted by the user and generates questions and answers based on the input displayed in a fashion similar to a cue card.

# Target Audience
This web app was created for students in middle school to young adults in their undergraduate programs, it is for anyone who needs to memorize facts and concepts.

# How it was Built
StudyBuddy was made with a mix of Express and React, as the backend and frontend respectively. An API call was done from the backend, processed, then passed back to the React frontend. We used gpt-3 software to analyze the given text and generate the questions and answers based on the analysis.

# What's next?
We believe that StudyBuddy is a resource that would be helpful to many students, therefore, we plan to keep the site up and running after the hackathon. Furthermore, we understand the shortcomings of StudyBuddy in fields like math or organic chemistry, so we plan to find a way to overcome those shortcomings and make StudyBuddy effective for every subject and student.
